    <h1>Coconut Curry Chickpeas With Pumpkin and Lime
By Melissa Clark</h1>
<h2>Total Time: 30 minutes
</h2>

<p>Canned pumpkin purée and coconut milk, heavily seasoned with curry spices and lots of fresh lime juice, make a sweet-sharp sauce for chickpeas.
   <br> It’s a rich, creamy curry that you can eat on its own, or serve over rice or couscous. If you want to incorporate more vegetables, stir in some spinach, 
   <br>baby kale or sliced green beans during the last few minutes of cooking, letting them soften in the sauce.</p>
